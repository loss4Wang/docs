Introduction Nowadays Machine learning and Deep learning are widely used in all subjects, both industry and research organizations take huge effort to apply these methods. I major in Information Management and Information System for my undergraudate study, and had some research experience related to Natural language Processing. I’m quite excited to study in the area of AI, especially in NLP/CL，since there are so many great contributors and huge progressed they’ve achieved. More is Less and Less is More! I believe that no matter how fast this field is growing, the most important thing we can do is to build a good foundation if we want to dive into it.
